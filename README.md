## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This work explores the effect of learning rate, batch size, dropout rate, number of epochs, and optimizer choice on CNN performance. Multiple architectures were evaluated, including **VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2**, using transfer learning.


All experiments were executed on **Kaggle Notebooks** with a **NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU** runtime for accelerated training.  
The full Kaggle notebooks, along with this GitHub repository, are publicly available for full reproducibility.


Experiments were conducted with:
- **Grid Search**
- **Random Search**
- **Bayesian Optimization** (Optuna)
